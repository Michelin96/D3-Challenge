# D3-challenge
Create a D3 scatter plot with data point tags from a U.S. Census Bureau dataset.

# Synopsis and Usage

Data from the U.S Census Bureau is used to to compare various health riskes to specific demographics. This dataset contains percentages of smokers, obese individuals, and those who lack health care. These risks are compared to the demographics of median age, median household income, and percentage of those in poverty.

By selecting one of the three demographics on the bottom axis, this chart will compare that selection to the percentage of those who lack healthcare.
