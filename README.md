# D3-challenge
Create a D3 scatter plot with data point tags from a U.S. Census Bureau dataset.

# Synopsis and Usage

Data from the U.S Census Bureau is used to compare various health riskes to specific demographics. This dataset contains percentages of smokers, obese individuals, and those who lack health care. These risks are compared to the demographics of median age, median household income, and percentage of those in poverty.

By selecting one of the three data sets on either axis, this chart will compare the selections to each other. For example, selecting "Age (Median)" and "Smokes (%)" will create a scatter plot that compares the median age in a particular state with the percentage of those who smoke.
