          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>The health risks evaluated are the percentages of smokers, obese individuals, and those who lack healthcare. These risks are compared to the demographics of median age, median household income, and percentage of those in poverty.</p>

          <p>The median age for most of the United States is between 36 and 42. Interestingly, Utah's median age is the lowest, at just above 30. They also have the lowest percentage of smokers. Massachusetts has the lowest percentage of those who lack health care, while Texas is the hightest around 25%. States in "the deep south", such as Mississippi, Lousiana, and Arkansas, rank highest for percentage of obese individuals.</p>

          <p>There is a definate correlation between States with a low median income and percentage of obesity. Mississippi, Arkansas, and West Virginia all have a median income near $40,000 and obesity is near 36%. Washtington D.C. has a high median income near $72,000, but only around 22% obesity. Median income seems to have an inverse correlation between smoking and obesity. States with a higher percentage of smokers have a lower percentage of obesity and vise versa. Mississippi and New Mexico have the highest percentage of those in poverty, nearly 22%. For all 51 regions, there is a visible trend that the percentage of those in poverty is nearly equal to the percentage of those who lack healthcare.</p>
